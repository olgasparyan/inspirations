# Personal inspirations and recommendations

This is a short repository where I wanted to orgamizwe some helpful resources, including scientific research articles and books, postcasts (mostly about science)
and projects that inspired me personally. All of these resources were created by women in science and industry (mostly tech-industry). These people inspire me every day, and maybe these resources can be helpful and inspiring for you too. The list is constantly updating.
